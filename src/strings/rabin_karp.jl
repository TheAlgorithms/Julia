    rabin_karp(text, pattern)

# Brief:
    A function that finds all occurrences of a pattern in the given text.
    Instead of checking each character ot the pattern with each character block of the text,
    for each character block calculate the hash value, and only if that value matches hash value of the pattern,
    compare them character by character. These blocks are the same length as the pattern.

# Returns:
    A list with starting indices where the pattern was found
