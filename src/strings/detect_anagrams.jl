Based on my exercism's Julia track problem solution on [Anagrams](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/0a1d39faa5694624b7750be3ebf6c974).

Instructions:

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word. Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.
Given "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana" the program should return a list containing "inlets".
