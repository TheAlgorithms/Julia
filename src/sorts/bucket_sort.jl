# Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
It distributes elements into buckets and sort each bucket before merging all buckets
Buckets are arrays that each stores a different range of elements
Insertion sort is used to sort the buckets because its fast in small-sized arrays

## Bucket Calculation

number of buckets = length of array
size of buckets = (largest element - smallest element + 1) / length of array

## Bucket Sort Steps

1. Create an array of buckets
2. Add each elements into its respective bucket
3. Sort each non-empty bucket
4. Concatenate elements of non-empty buckets

## Example

1. Array of [3, 5, 2, 9] has 4 buckets
2. The size of buckets = (9 - 2 + 1) / 4 = 2
3. The range of elements can be assign to each bucket, x
    bucket 1: 2 <= x < 4
    bucket 2: 4 <= x < 6
    bucket 3: 6 <= x < 8
    bucket 4: 8 <= x <= 9
4. The distribution of elements in the buckets = [3, 2][5][][9]
5. After sorting the elements each bucket = [2, 3][5][][9]
6. Concatenate all elements = [2, 3, 5, 9]

# Example
```julia
BucketSort!([3, 5, 2, 9]) # returns [2, 3, 5, 9]
```
