    ExchangeSort(arr)

Sort an array by exchanging elements that are not in their proper position, hence Exchange Sort

Exchange Sort Steps
1. Compares each element of an array
2. Swap those elements that are not in their proper position

Example
1. An array of [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] and compare each elements
2. Since 4 is greater than 3
3. Swap both position
4. Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Program to sort an array

# Example
```julia
ExchangeSort([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) # returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ExchangeSort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ExchangeSort(['5', '4', '3', '2', '1']) # returns ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```
