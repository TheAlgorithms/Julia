    heap_sort!(arr::Vector{T}, gt = >, N::Int = length(arr)) where {T}

Sort the given vector (in-place) using the Heapsort algorithm.

Heapsort consists of two stages:
  1. Building a (max) heap of the array
  2. Repeatedly extracting the largest element and inserting it at the front of the sorted part of the array

After the largest element has been extracted, the tree is updated to maintain the heap property via a "sifting" operation.

  Storing a heap in an array is pretty straightforward - for every node with index n, its children are stored at indices
  2n + 1 and 2n + 2 (for 0-based indices). Index 0 contains the root node.
  Since Julia's indices are 1-based, we need to change this a little bit. We're using a trivial helper function 
  idx_for to convert from 0-based to 1-based.

  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort for a complete explanation of Heapsort.
