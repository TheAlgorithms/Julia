"""
   A K-Means algorithm for data clustering

# Brief:
    The algorithm takes n-dimensional points represented as a vector where each element of that vector
    corresponds to one dimension of the point. In the beginning, the algorithm select k points.
    Every of the k points is used as a centre of the cluster. In each iteration, every of these k points
    is connected to the nearest points and moved, until it stops changing its position through iterations.
