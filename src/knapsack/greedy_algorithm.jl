For greedy algorithm, it will take the element based on the optimal value in the array at each loop in the function

This does 0-1 (each item can be chosen only once) knapsack :
pack capacity = capacity
weight of each item = weights
value of each item = values

Each loop the function will find the highest value in the array and check if the capacity is enough to store it, if enough then 
the value will be added into the total_max_value. 
After that the highest current value will be deleted.
