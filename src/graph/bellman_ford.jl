    bellman_ford(graph::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int, Int}}, source::Int)

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm which computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm, which solves the same problem, but it is capable of handling graphs with negative edge weights.
Instead of greedily performing the relaxation on the vertices, Bellman-Ford simply relaxes all edges, and does this |V|-1 times.

# Arguments:
- `graph`: a directed, weighted graph
- `source`: the source vertex from which to begin the traversal

# Example
```jldoctest
graph = [
    (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 2),
    (2, 3, 3), (2, 4, 2), (2, 5, 3),
    (3, 2, 1), (3, 4, 4), (3, 5, 5),
    (5, 4, -5)
]
bellman_ford(graph, 1)

# output

5-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 3
 2
 1
 6
```
