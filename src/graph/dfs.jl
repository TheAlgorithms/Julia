    dfs(graph::Vector{Vector{Int}}, source::Int)

Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
The algorithm starts at a given vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
This implementation is for educational purposes only, so it simply prints out the vertices in the order that they were traversed.

# Arguments:
- `graph`: a directed, unweighted graph
- `source`: the source vertex from which to begin the traversal

# Example
```jldoctest
graph = [
    [2, 3, 6], 
    [3, 4],
    [4],
    [1, 2, 5],
    [2],
    [1, 5]
]
dfs(graph, 6)

# output

6 5 2 4 3 1
```
