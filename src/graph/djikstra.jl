    dijkstra(graph::Vector{Vector{Tuple{Int,Int}}}, source::Int)

Given a directed graph with weights on the arcs and a source vertex, the dijkstra algorithm
calculates the distance from the source to all other vertices, and the solution tree associated
with those distances. The solution tree is given by a vector `prev` which stores the source of the
arc that arrives at each vertex. By definition: distance[source] = prev[source] = 0. If a vertex v
is not reachable from the source, then distance[v] = prev[v] = -1.

# Arguments:
- `graph`: a directed graph with weights on the arcs
- `source`: the source vertex from which the distances will be calculated

# Example
```jldoctest
graph = [
    [(2, 8), (3, 6), (4, 4)],
    [(3, 1), (5, 5)],
    [(5, 4)],
    [(2, 3), (5, 9)],
    [(1, 2), (3, 2), (4, 5)],
    [(1, 1), (4, 3)],
]
distances, prev = dijkstra(graph, 1)

println("v | dist | path")
for v in eachindex(graph)
    distance = distances[v] == -1 ? "  NR" : lpad(distances[v], 4) # NR: Non Reachable
    path = join(get_dijkstra_path(prev, v), " -> ")
    println("\$v | \$distance | \$path")
end

# output

v | dist | path
1 |    0 | 1
2 |    7 | 1 -> 4 -> 2
3 |    6 | 1 -> 3
4 |    4 | 1 -> 4
5 |   10 | 1 -> 3 -> 5
6 |   NR | 
```
