    Smallest multiple
    
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Input parameters:
- `limit`: Limit upto which to find the smallest multiple.

# Examples/Tests:
```julia
problem_005(10) # returns 2520
problem_005(20) # returns 232792560
problem_005(-1) # throws DomainError
```
