    fcfs(n, process_id, burst_time)

Implementation of first come first served scheduling algorithm

# Output
Tuple of vectors (process_id, burst_time, waiting_time, turnaround_time, avg_waiting_time, avg_turnaround_time)

# Example

```julia
n = 3 # number of processes
process_id = Any[1, 2, 3] # process ids
burst_times = Any[3, 4, 5] # burst times
fcfs(n, process_id, burst_times)
```
