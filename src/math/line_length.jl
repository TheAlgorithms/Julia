"""
    line_length(f, x_start, x_end, steps=100)

Approximates the arc length of a line segment by treating the curve as a
sequence of linear lines and summing their lengths.

Arguments:
 - f: function that returns the arc
 - x_start: starting x value
 - x_end: ending x_value
 - steps: steps to take for accurace, more the steps greater the accuracy
