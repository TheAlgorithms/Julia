"""
Verlet integration is an integration method used to integrate newtons - law of motion. It is frequently used to find trajectories in molecular dynamics simulation.
The function takes `four` inputs viz,
- `f` : the differential equation
- `x0` : the initial condition. This is a Vector with the first element as initial value for position(x_0) and the the second  initial condition for velocity (v_0) 
- `tspan`: is the time span for integration. It is a tuple (initial time, final time)
This functionr returns a tuple (x,t):
- `x` is the solution
- `t` is the array containing the time points
