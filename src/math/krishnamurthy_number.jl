    krishnamurthy(number)

Check if a number is a Krishnamurthy number or not

# Details

It is also known as Peterson Number. 

A Krishnamurthy Number is a number whose sum of the
factorial of the digits equals to the original
number itself.

For example: 145 = 1! + 4! + 5!
    So, 145 is a Krishnamurthy Number

# Example

```julia
krishnamurthy(145) # returns true
krishnamurthy(240) # returns false
krishnamurthy(1)   # returns true 
```
