    determinant(mat)

Given a non singluar matrix, calculate its determinant using LU decomposition.

L and U are lower triangular and upper triangular matrices respectively such that

A = L*U

If we want to find the determinant, then

det(A) = det(LU) = det(L)*det(U)

Determinant of triangualar matrices is the product of their diagonal entries. Hence, makes finding the determinant easy.
