## How to contribute?

#### **Adding a new algorithm**

New contributors should only have one PR per algorithm

- Clone this repository:
    - through git `git clone https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Julia`; or
    - through github cli `gh repo clone TheAlgorithms/Julia`.
- Describe the algorithm in the PR. Explain what it does.
- Add documentation in the code.
- Add tests and fix any CodeCov issues.
- We appreciate if you only have one commit of your PR as too many commits mess conversations within the PR.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned‚Äù to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and it will be evaluated by project maintainers.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any questions about how to use the repository in the [The Algorithms room in Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#) or in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/c7MnfGFGa6) server.

That is all you need to know about the process. Now it is your turn to help us improve the repository; thank you!
