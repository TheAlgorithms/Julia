## How to contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned‚Äù to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and it will be evaluated by project maintainers.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use the repository in the [TheAlgorithms room in Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#)!

That is all you need to know about the process now it is your turn to help us improve the repository, thank you!
